/**
 * Performs a glob-style pattern matching.
 *
 * The following special characters are supported for the `pattern`:
 *
 * - '*' matches every sequence of characters, except for slash ('/').
 * - '**' plus '/' matches every sequence of characters, including slash ('/').
 *
 * If the `pattern` doesn't contain a slash ('/'), only the last path
 * component of the `subject` (its basename) will be matched against
 * the `pattern`. Otherwise if at least one slash is found in `pattern`
 * the full `subject` is matched against the `pattern`.
 *
 * @param pattern the wildcard pattern
 * @param subject the subject URL to test against
 * @return whether the `subject` matches the given `pattern`.
